Dear ABC Bank Support,

I recently noticed a transaction on my account that I do not fully recognize.
Details are as follows:
    - Date: 2025-03-20
    - Transaction: Online Purchase at XYZ Retailer
    - Amount: $350.00
I kindly request a detailed explanation and a copy of the receipt or reference number 
associated with this transaction. Please let me know if any additional information is 
required from my side.

I would also like to request activation of your mobile banking service. I believe this 
service will greatly enhance my ability to manage my account on the go. Kindly provide 
the necessary steps or a contact person to facilitate the activation process.

Thank you for your prompt attention to these matters.

Sincerely,
John Doe
